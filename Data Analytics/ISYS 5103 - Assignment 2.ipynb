    "    - Predict - Run - Investigate: \n",
    "        - examine the code and write down in a markdown cell what you think the code will do\n",
    "        - run the code and see if your prediction is right or wrong.  If wrong, that is okay. \n",
    "        - if your prediction was wrong, diagnose why, and document why (if you don't know, document that as well)\n",
    "    - Modify:\n",
    "        - take existing code and modify it. Modifying may also include adapting or even fixing a piece of code.\n",
    "    - Make:\n",
    "        - take what we have covered in class and create a piece of code to answer the question.\n",
